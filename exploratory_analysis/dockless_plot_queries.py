        * The goal here is show that dockless bike utilization has been much lower than CaBi due to such few bikes being available
        * Also should be interesting to see how the scooters have impacted Lime utilization in March and April (scooters introed on March 12th)
        * This table will only be for the time period we have API data, so mid February to April
