# Bikeshare-DC

Capstone Project for Data Science Certificate Program at Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies.

Our goal is to calculate the impact that the November 2017 - April 2018 DDOT dockless bikeshare pilot has had on Capital Bikeshare and forecast demand of DC Capital Bikeshare for Summer/Fall 2018 assuming a large increase in the number of dockless bikes and recommend an optimal number of dockless bikes that will allow for capital bikeshare to continue to grow and dockless bikeshare to grow organically in the DC area.
