## Abstract

## NDA Explanation

Please note that in order to receive data shared with the DC Department of Transportation (DDOT) by the dockless operators participating in the dockless pilot, we as a Capstone Project team, had to sign a non-disclosure agreement with DDOT.  We have presented our finding to DDOT and agreed not to share any dockless specific analysis only in our report and presentation that can only be shared with Georgetown Data Science faculty and students and not for wider distribution.

The remainder of this README will walk through our finding that were Capital Bikeshare (CaBi) specific (i.e. stopping at our machine learning models, just before explaining the potential impact of the dockless bikeshare impact on CaBi)
